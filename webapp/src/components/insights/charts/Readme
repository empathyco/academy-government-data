All the charts components that are in this folder are made under the Highcharts library.
All them have their own properties, some of them are common, others are specific of each chart.

One important point is that the data received by those charts varies (despite all charts receiving the same object,
which you can find the constructor with the format of the object in src/utils/DataConstructor, some will only receive
one serie of data while others are able to receive multiple series).

In order to make a difference between those two, this is the classification:

Word cloud and pie chart will only be able to receive a single set* of data (receiving more than one set will result in
overlapping graphics).

Bar chart, bubble chart and line plot will all be able to receive one or many sets* of data, dividing them and treating them
differently).

*When we are referring to sets of data, we are saying that all sets will have the type:
{
  content: {
    name: string,
    data: {
      name: string,
      value: number,
    }[],
  }[],
}

where each content object is a set of data.
